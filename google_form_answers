That is because I haven't created a Pokemon model yet.

In home_controller.rb, it gathers all pokemons with no trainer first. Then, it chooses a sample among the trainer-less pokemons, which is a default random method provided by rails. The common factor is that their trainer property is nil - they are all trainer-less.

After we patch "capture", it will call capture method in pokemons_controller, as written in routes.rb. Then, the id of the current trainer-less pokemon is passed as a parameter. Then, capture method will update the current pokemon's trainer information, so that the current pokemon is captured by current trainer.
